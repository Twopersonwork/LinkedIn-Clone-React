## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This package is a new implementation of the `Snackbar` component from `v1`.
There should now be some accessibility fixes and hopefully a better way to queue
messages as well as cancel them but I also feel like I might need to re-work
this again to work without the React context API.

### New Behavior and Features

- requires mounting a `MessageQueue` context provider near the root of your app
- messages are now queued by using the new `useAddMessage` hook
- multiline and stacked behavior is now configurable at a per-message basis with
  the new `useAddMessage` hook
- adding an action button is now configurable at a per-message basis with the
  `useAddDMessage` hook
- supports four message priorities:
  - `"normal"` (default) - add to the end of the queue
  - `"next"` - show immediately if there are no existing messages in the queue
    or show immediately after the current message is hidden
  - `"immediate"` - hide the current message (if exists) to show this message.
    once this message is hidden, show the message that was playing (if there was
    one) and continue the queue
  - `"replace"` - replaces the current message with whatever content is provided
    while maintaining the current timeout duration
- supports additional duplicate behavior:
  - `"allow"` (default) - add any duplicated message as normal
  - `"restart"` - if a message appears with the same `messageId`, restart the
    timer and do not add another message to the end of the queue
  - `"prevent"` - do not add the message to the queue and do not restart the
    timer if there is already a message with the same `messageId` in the queue
- changed from an `alert`/`alertdialog` role into a
  [status role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_status_role)
- added better support for an action button
- added a `useQueue` hook if you need to see what messages are currently queued
  and their order

### Breaking Changes

- no longer attempts to update its position if there is a floating action button
  in the app since floating action buttons aren't implemented by default and it
  didn't really work as expected
- no longer attempts to determine if the message is multiline automatically
- the `SnackbarContainer` no longer exists and was replaced by the new
  `MessageQueue`
