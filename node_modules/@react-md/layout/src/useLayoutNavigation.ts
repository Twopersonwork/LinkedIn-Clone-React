 * @see LayoutNavigationTree for description of the navItems
 * @param navItems - All the navigation items within your layout. This is used
 * for determining which parent tree items should be expanded when the route
 * changes so the current route won't be hidden from view. This sort of flow
 * happens if you have a link outside of the navigation tree.
 * @param pathname - The current pathname
 * @param linkComponent - The link component to use within the navigation tree
 * for any item that has a `to` or `href` attribute. This defaults to the `Link`
 * from `@react-md/link` but should be changed to whatever link component you
 * need if using a routing library like `react-router`.
