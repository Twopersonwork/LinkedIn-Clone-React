     * However, this means that the `children` must be a single element that
     * forwards the `ref` correctly to a DOM node which might be a hassle.
     *
     * Enabling this prop will just update the `CrossFade` to wrap the `children`
     * in a `<div>` and apply that transition to that instead.
     *
     * Note: The `HTMLAttributes` for the `HTMLDivElement` other than the
     * `className` are only valid for this component when this prop is set to
     * `true`.

 * The `Collapse` is really just a convenience wrapper for the `useCrossFade`
 * hook that triggers the transition by cloning the `ref` and `className` into
 * the `children` of this component.
 *
 * This transition will only fire on mount and when the `appear` prop is set to
 * `true`, so the way to trigger new animations is by changing the `key` for
 * this component so it re-mounts. However it is generally not recommended to
 * fire this transition on first page load especially when dealing with server
 * side rendering. A simple way to work around this is have the `CrossFade` near
 * the root of the app and just disable the `appear` prop until the first
 * render.
 *
 * If you want more fine-grain control over the transition, it is recommended to
 * use the `useCrossFade` hook instead.
