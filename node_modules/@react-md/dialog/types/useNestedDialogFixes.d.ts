/**
 * This hook is used to fix the nested overlays and the escape keypress when
 * multiple dialogs are rendered at the same time on a page. All it really does
 * is keep a stack of the dialog ids that are current visible. If there is more
 * than 1 dialog visible and the dialog is not at the top of the stack, the
 * overlay and escape keypress will be disabled.
 *
 * NOTE: This will not work if you nest dialogs together and have them become
 * visible at the same time because the ids will get added from child to parent
 * instead of parent -&gt; child. This flow shouldn't really happen though so it
 * isn't planned on being fixed.
