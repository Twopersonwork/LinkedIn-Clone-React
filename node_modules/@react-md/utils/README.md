}
```

### Usage with other packages

One of the great things about this package is that there is a mixin that will
automatically include all the react-md styles for packages you have included in
this file.

```scss
@import "~@react-md/app-bar/dist/mixins";
@import "~@react-md/avatar/dist/mixins";
@import "~@react-md/button/dist/mixins";
@import "~@react-md/elevation/dist/mixins";
@import "~@react-md/utils/dist/mixins";

@include react-md-utils;
```

The example above will automatically include the styles for the `app-bar`,
`avatar`, and `button` packages as well as the base styles utils styles.
