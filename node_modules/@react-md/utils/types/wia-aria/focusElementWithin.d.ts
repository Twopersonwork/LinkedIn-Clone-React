 * @param focus - Either the "first" or "last" string to focus the first or last
 * focusable element within the container or a query selector string to find a
 * focusable element within the container.
 * @param programmatic - Boolean if programmatically focusable elements should be
 * included as well.
 * @param preventScroll - Boolean if the focus event should not scroll the
 * element into view. This should normally remain `false`, but can be useful if
 * the element gets focused while offscreen during a transition.
 * @param elements - Optonal child elements to search
 * @remarks \@since 2.8.0 Supports focusing the container element if it is
 * focusable
