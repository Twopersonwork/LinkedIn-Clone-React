## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This package is pretty new for `react-md`, but might be seen as a replacement
for the old grid, helpers, and utils.

### New Behavior and Features

- automatically update styles for right to left languages (opt-out)
- static sizing across all screen sizes with opt-in support for an auto-dense
  theme if desired
- better keyboard focus behavior for temporary elements so that keyboard focus
  is not lost after traversing between multiple menus, dialogs, sheets, etc
- better keyboard movement with `aria-activedescendant` behavior or focus
  behavior
- built-in **keyboard search** for DOM elements that require it
- built-in support for determining the current app size based on media queries
  with both mixins and hooks
- lots of additional utility mixins for common styling patterns
- the default grid system now uses css grid instead of flexbox for layout
- a second grid system that creates dynamic number of columns based on a max
  width provided
- the grid system no longer uses its own breakpoints and uses the phone, tablet,
  and desktop breakpoints
- simplified css reset touching as few html tags as possible: `html` and `body`
  only. still applies `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements though
- "feature detection" utility mixin to only include styles for installed scoped
  `react-md` packages with `react-md-utils`

### Breaking Changes

- removed `react-md-helpers-everything`
- removed `.md-full-width`, `.md-inline-block`, and `.md-block-centered` helper
  classes
- changed the media query behavior and device detection
- grid system now uses grid instead of flexbox and no longer supports a custom
  max-width through the scss variables with a container
- `FocusContainer` renamed all of the props
- renamed/removed all remaining scss variables, functions, mixins, and
  placeholders

#### New Components, Hooks, and Utils

This package contains many useful utilities for internal use, but also exports
some components and hooks that might be useful externally.

- `AppSizeListener` and `useAppSize` are used to determine the current app size
  based on media queries. Multiple components within `react-md` rely on this
  behavior
- `ResizeListener` is a component that can be used to trigger a callback on
  throttled window resize events and a `useResizeListener` hook version
- `ResizeObserver` is a component that is used to use the [ResizeObserverAPI] to
  track a specific element resizing as well as a `useResizeObserver` hook
  version
- `PhoneOnly`, `MobileOnly`, `TabletOnly`, and `DesktopOnly` components can be
  used to conditionally render content only when one of the media types are
  active
- `UserInteractionModeListener`, `useUserInterationMode`, and
  `useIsUserInteractionMode` are used to determine how the current user is
  interacting with your app with either: touch, mouse, or keyboard
- `Grid` and `GridCell` can be used to create a CSS Grid layout using the
  material design grid layout or a static number of columns
- `GridList` and `GridListCell` can be used to create a flex based layout where
  each cell grows up to the specified max width and tries to fit as many cells
  as possible based on the `GridList`'s width
- `useTabFocusWrap` hook for containing focus within an element if the
  `FocusContainer` does not suit your needs
- `useFocusOnMount` hook if you'd like to focus a specific element when a
  component mounts if the `FocusContainer` does not suit your needs
- `usePreviousFocus` hook if you'd like to focus the previously focused element
  in the DOM before this component mounted once this component unmounts
- `useScrollLock` hook to temporarily disable scrollbars within the app for
  temporary elements
- `useCloseOnOutsideClick` hook if a callback should be fired once an element
  outside of a container element has been clicked

##### Honorable Mentions

- `isContrastCompliant` - utility function to check if two hex colors meet a
  minimal contrast ratio compliance for accessibility
- `bem` - if you like using [BEM] for class name convention, helps dynamically
  apply classes as needed
- `caseInsensitiveFilter` and `fuzzyFilter` utils for filtering a list of data
- `findIgnoreCase` - utility to find the first match within a list
- `useKeyboardSearch` - accessibility hook to allow a list of to be keyboard
  searchable within the DOM
- `useKeyboardFocusMovement` and `useActiveDescendantMovement` for handling
  custom keyboard movement of DOM elements
- `getFixedPosition` - utility to generate styles for an element so it is fixed
  within the viewport. However, you most likely are looking for the
  `useFixedPositioning` hook in [@react-md/transition]

  be used instead
- removed `$md-tablet-media`, `$md-tablet-portrait-media`, and
  `$md-tablet-landscape-media` since the `rmd-utils-tablet-media` and
  `rmd-utils-tablet-only-media` mixins should be used instead
- removed `$md-media-included` since the `rmd-utils-dense` mixin should be used
  instead if you want to automatically create a dense theme on desktops
- removed `$md-tablet-breakpoint` and `$md-desktop-breakpoint` since the grid
  uses the same breakpoints as all other components now
- removed `$md-grid-phone-margin`, `$md-grid-phone-gutter`,
  `$md-grid-tablet-margin`, `$md-grid-tablet-gutter`, `$md-grid-desktop-margin`,
  and `$md-grid-desktop-gutter` since there is now a static size across all app
  sizes
- removed all the old grid mixins: `react-md-grid`,
  `react-md-make-grid-container`, `react-md-grid-mobile`,
  `react-md-grid-tablet`, `react-md-grid-desktop`, `react-md-make-custom-grid`,
  `react-md-make-grid`, `react-md-make-cells`, `react-md-grid-media`,
  `react-md-cell-size`, `react-md-grid-full`, and `react-md-cell-offset` since
  the new grid system doesn't need styling in this manner
