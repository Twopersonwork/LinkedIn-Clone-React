 * FontIcon to return the textContent instead. This is because the FontIcon's
 * text content would also be returned from the node's text content.

 * @param stringOrElement - Either a string or an element element to convert
 * @param fontIconQuerySelector - A string to use for finding font icons in the
 * HTML Element. When this is set to the empty string, the element will not be
 * checked for font icons which _might_ be a slight performance boost if you are
 * guarenteed to not use font icons
