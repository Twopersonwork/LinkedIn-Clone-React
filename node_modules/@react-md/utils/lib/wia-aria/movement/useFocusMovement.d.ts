 * To use this hook, you'll want to update the container element of all the
 * items to have a correct `role` applied as well as the `onKeyDown` event
 * handler provided by this hook. Then, you'll want to applied a
 * `ref={itemRefs[i]}` for each item within the items list so that the DOM nodes
 * can be focused as needed. Unfortunately, this means that all the child items
 * **must** either be an HTMLElement or the ref is forwarded down to the
 * HTMLElement.
 *
 * @typeParam D - The type of each data item within the items list.
 * @typeParam CE - The HTMLElement type of the container element that handles
 * the custom keyboard movement.
 * @typeParam IE - The HTMLElement type of each item within the container
 * element that can be focusable.
